# Portfolio Site

*This code was written for a class project and therefore had 
to conform to certain specifications.  Please see the roadmap
below indicating what changes will be coming as I make it
my own.*

### Roadmap
* **HTTPS:** get a secure connection established.
* **Simple redesigns:** the site is intentionally minimalist and that will not change,
  but there are some layout updates that need to be made and responsiveness needs to
  be ensured
* **CSS to Sass:** I like the conveniences of writing in Sass, but that was not an
  option for the project.
* **Handlebars to Pug/Jade:** I had never used handlebars before this project, and it
  seems pretty nice, but I would like to continue using pug/jade for most projects.
* **reCaptcha:** Add reCaptcha to the form to limit the number of robots I have to
  hear from.
* **Form Emails:** Currently the form submissions just get saved to a database. I could
  have node.js send me emails of the submission, but I think I'm going to write a
  Python script to check the database daily and send out an email.
* **Favicon:** I should add one in case you find the content so compelling you want
  to bookmark the site.
* **Slideshow:** Currently the slideshow continues to scroll even when it is being
  interacted with.  This is not a good user experience.  I will be fixing that.
* **Admin Interface:** I should create a simple interface I can log in to, which
  would allow me to quickly add new books I've read, or update my CV (both download
  and for display).
* **Blog?:** I've thought about this for a while. I'd like to have a blog to
  consolidate my ideas, view my progress, understand from where I've come.  I'm
  not sure if I will do this or not.
