                        <p>
                            This started as a final project for an intro to computer
                            science class. I enjoyed the project and thought it would
                            be a good opportunity to try creating a GUI. I opted for
                            Qt because it is cross platform, widely used, and works
                            with both Python and C++.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While Qt uses a model/view paradigm, I chose to implement
                            the UI using an MVC paradigm. I wanted practice with MVC
                            and thought this would be a good opportunity to try it out.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This site was created for a trail race director in Indiana.
                            It has gone through a few different iterations in design
                            and backend and will likely go through a few more.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Currently, this static site is built using node.js and gulp
                            to compile a series of JSON files holding race and result
                            data. The resulting files are uploaded to an apache server.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When new result data is to be added, I run a script I wrote
                            in Python that converts the .pdf I'm given to a JSON file
                            which is then used in the previously mentioned build process.
                            I previously did this work on a Linux system (either Ubuntu or
                            Fedora) but recently have been using Windows 10 with the Windows
                            Subsystem for Linux version 2.

                            This site has an older design I made which could use an update.
                            I have learned a lot of new techniques since then and also,
                            importantly, subtlety.  This is one fo the first sites I created.

                            This is my portfolio. There are many others like it,
                            but this one is mine. Full Metal Jacket references aside,
                            you are already here and have probably seen a bit of what
                            this site is already about. It started as a final project
                            for a web development class, but will persist and be
                            developed and maintained as I continue to learn.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While I would generally opt for using Pug(Jade), due to
                            requirements of the initial project, I am using handlebars.
                            I like handlebars just fine, but prefer Pug due to the more
                            succinct syntax.  I would typically use Sass instead of plain
                            CSS, but again this was first for a project. A later
                            implementation may be with other technology.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The backend is completed with node.js and express.js which,
                            as far as web development goes, is pretty great. Writing
                            JavaScript is not my favorite thing, but server side JavaScript
                            is significantly better than writing client side JavaScript from
                            2013 when I first started learning any of this.
