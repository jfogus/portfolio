                                |  a space for plasma cutter enthusiasts to share
                                |  their .dxf files. These files are similar to .svg files and are
                                |  patterns which feed instructions to the plasma cutter on how
                                |  what path to take when cutting the metal.
                            p I opted for using the MERN stack. This is my first time using a NoSQL
                                |  database, but having worked with JSON, MongoDB is very intuitive.

                                |  be a good opportunity to try creating a GUI. I opted for
                                |  Qt because it is cross platform, widely used, and works
                                |  with both Python and C++.
                            p While Qt uses a model/view paradigm, I chose to implement
                                |  the UI using an MVC paradigm. I wanted practice with MVC
                                |  and thought this would be a good opportunity to try it out.

                            p This site was created for a trail race director in Indiana.
                                |  It has gone through a few different iterations in design
                                |  and backend and will likely go through a few more.
                            p Currently, this static site is built using node.js and gulp
                                |  to compile a series of JSON files holding race and result
                                |  data. The resulting files are uploaded to an apache server.
                            p When new result data is to be added, I run a script I wrote
                                |  in Python that converts the .pdf I'm given to a JSON file
                                |  which is then used in the previously mentioned build process.
                                |  I previously did this work on a Linux system (either Ubuntu or
                                |  Fedora) but recently have been using Windows 10 with the Windows
                                |  Subsystem for Linux version 2.

                                |  importantly, subtlety.  This is one fo the first sites I created.
                                |  It is one single page with no internal links by request of the
                                |  client.

                            p This is my portfolio. There are many others like it,
                                |  but this one is mine. Full Metal Jacket references aside,
                                |  you are already here and have probably seen a bit of what
                                |  this site is already about. It started as a final project
                                |  for a web development class, but will persist and be
                                |  developed and maintained as I continue to learn.
                            p While I would generally opt for using Pug(Jade), due to
                                |  requirements of the initial project, I am using handlebars.
                                |  I like handlebars just fine, but prefer Pug due to the more
                                |  succinct syntax.  I would typically use Sass instead of plain
                                |  CSS, but again this was first for a project. A later
                                |  implementation may be with other technology.
                            p The backend is completed with node.js and express.js which,
                                |  as far as web development goes, is pretty great. Writing
                                |  JavaScript is not my favorite thing, but server side JavaScript
                                |  is significantly better than writing client side JavaScript from
                                |  2013 when I first started learning any of this.
