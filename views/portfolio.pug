                                    p This started as a final project for an intro to computer
                                        |  science class. I enjoyed the project and thought it would
                                        |  be a good opportunity to try creating a GUI. I opted for
                                        |  Qt because it is cross platform, widely used, and works
                                        |  with both Python and C++.
                                    p While Qt uses a model/view paradigm, I chose to implement
                                        |  the UI using an MVC paradigm. I wanted practice with MVC
                                        |  and thought this would be a good opportunity to try it out.

                                    p This site was created for a trail race director in Indiana.
                                        |  It has gone through a few different iterations in design
                                        |  and backend and will likely go through a few more.
                                    p Currently, this static site is built using node.js and gulp
                                        |  to compile a series of JSON files holding race and result
                                        |  data. The resulting files are uploaded to an apache server.
                                    p When new result data is to be added, I run a script I wrote
                                        |  in Python that converts the .pdf I'm given to a JSON file
                                        |  which is then used in the previously mentioned build process.
                                        |  I previously did this work on a Linux system (either Ubuntu or
                                        |  Fedora) but recently have been using Windows 10 with the Windows
                                        |  Subsystem for Linux version 2.

                                        |  I have learned a lot of new techniques since then and also,
                                        |  importantly, subtlety.  This is one fo the first sites I created.

                                    p This is my portfolio. There are many others like it,
                                        |  but this one is mine. Full Metal Jacket references aside,
                                        |  you are already here and have probably seen a bit of what
                                        |  this site is already about. It started as a final project
                                        |  for a web development class, but will persist and be
                                        |  developed and maintained as I continue to learn.
                                    p While I would generally opt for using Pug(Jade), due to
                                        |  requirements of the initial project, I am using handlebars.
                                        |  I like handlebars just fine, but prefer Pug due to the more
                                        |  succinct syntax.  I would typically use Sass instead of plain
                                        |  CSS, but again this was first for a project. A later
                                        |  implementation may be with other technology.
                                    p The backend is completed with node.js and express.js which,
                                        |  as far as web development goes, is pretty great. Writing
                                        |  JavaScript is not my favorite thing, but server side JavaScript
                                        |  is significantly better than writing client side JavaScript from
                                        |  2013 when I first started learning any of this.
